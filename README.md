## Flexodoro

The Pomodoro Technique increases productivity by encouraging periods of intense focus that are broken up by intervals of rest.  A standard Pomodoro cycle is 25 minutes of focus followed by 5 minutes of rest.

The problem with traditional Pomodoro timers is that the 25 minute timer often interrupts work flow. The solution is a flexible Pomodoro timer that only suggests these intervals but does not require them.

Flexodoro is a flexible Pomodoro time tracker that uses the 25 to 5 ratio to provide suggested focus and rest times. Depending on your work flow, you can enter focus mode or rest mode at will and Flexodoro will adjust your next suggested cycle accordingly.

Flexodoro Provides:
1. Suggested focus and rest intervals based on the 5 to 1 ratio
2. Tracks and records each cycle by date

Does this work `to add code?`
